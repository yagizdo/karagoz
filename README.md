# Karagöz

Device automation for mobile apps. One tool for four targets: Android emulator, Android physical device, iOS simulator, iOS physical device. It is a CLI, and `karagoz mcp` serves the same commands to an AI agent as an [MCP server](#mcp-server).

> **Status: early development.** Twelve commands work on the Android emulator, `devices`, `screenshot`, `ui-tree`, `tap`, `swipe`, `text`, `key`, `install`, `launch`, `terminate`, `uninstall` and `logs` also work on a physical Android device, `doctor` reports the `adb` they use, and the MCP server offers all thirteen to an AI agent. `devices` also lists iOS simulators; nothing else is written for iOS yet. Nothing is published to npm. See [Status](#status).

"Done" means tested against a live emulator: macOS, an API 36 image (Android 16), 1080x2400 at 420 dpi. In the iOS simulator column it means the step's smoke passes on macOS: `smoke/3.1-devices-ios.sh` for `devices`, `smoke/3.2-screenshot-ios.sh` for `screenshot`. `devices`, `screenshot` and `ui-tree` were tested on a physical Samsung phone (Android 14) over USB, and `tap`, `swipe`, `text`, `key`, `install`, `launch`, `terminate`, `uninstall` and `logs` on an Infinix phone (Android 12) over USB. No other command has been run on one yet. `doctor` touches no device; its row means tested on the same Mac with fake and real `adb` binaries. For the MCP server, done means `smoke/M-mcp.sh` passes against the live emulator and Claude Code and Codex called its tools; in the Android device column it means its tools returned results from a phone over USB. Windows and Linux have not been run.

## Requirements

- **Node 22 or newer.**
- **`adb`** from Android platform-tools, for Android targets. karagoz does not bundle it; it looks for it on every run, in this order:
  1. `$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb`
  2. `$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/platform-tools/adb`
  3. `adb` on `PATH`
  4. Android Studio's default SDK: `~/Library/Android/sdk` on macOS, `~/Android/Sdk` on Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk` on Windows

  An empty variable is skipped. The first `adb` that starts is used for the rest of the run, so a broken `adb` under `ANDROID_HOME` does not fall back to `PATH`. The exception is an `adb` that fails to start with `ENOENT` (a missing interpreter or a broken link): it counts as not there, and the next one is tried. Under `karagoz mcp` the run is the whole server session, and if the `adb` in use disappears (`ENOENT`), the next call looks it up again. An `adb` that appears mid-session higher in the list is not picked up until the server restarts. [`karagoz doctor`](#doctor) shows which one is used and why. `install` needs platform-tools 30.0.0 or newer. When none is found:

  ```json
  {"error":{"code":"ADB_NOT_FOUND","message":"adb not found (tried ..., PATH). Install platform-tools (brew install --cask android-platform-tools, or download https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools and add it to PATH) or set ANDROID_HOME to your Android SDK."}}
  ```

- **A running emulator** (`emulator -avd <name>`), or for `devices`, `screenshot`, `ui-tree`, `tap`, `swipe`, `text`, `key`, `install`, `launch`, `terminate`, `uninstall` and `logs`, a phone with USB debugging on, in state `device`, or for `devices` and `screenshot` on macOS, a booted iOS simulator (`open -a Simulator`). karagoz installs nothing on a device by itself; `install` installs only the APK you pass it. A phone that adb cannot see is missing from the list: on Windows without the phone maker's USB driver, on a Mac laptop where "Allow accessory to connect" was refused, or in fastboot mode.
- For `smoke/1.5-app-lifecycle.sh`, and for `smoke/2.5-app-lifecycle-physical.sh` when a phone is attached: a JDK and Android SDK build-tools with one platform. Both smokes build their own test APK, `dev.karagoz.smoke`, and remove it at the end. See [Development](#development).
- For `ui-tree` and `tap --text` / `--id`: the screen is on, and no other UiAutomation client is connected (Appium, Maestro, `uiautomator events`). For input to reach apps, the screen is also unlocked: on a lock screen `text` and `key` type into the PIN field, and a wrong PIN counts as a failed unlock attempt; with the screen off, taps are dropped and keys still arrive. Both exit `0`.
- **Xcode, opened once**, for iOS simulators in `devices` and `screenshot` (macOS only). karagoz runs CoreSimulator's own `simctl` (`/Library/Developer/PrivateFrameworks/CoreSimulator.framework/Versions/A/Resources/bin/simctl`), or `$DEVELOPER_DIR/usr/bin/simctl` when `DEVELOPER_DIR` is set. The Command Line Tools alone have no `simctl`. On macOS every command that targets a device runs it too, to list simulators ([Device selection](#device-selection)).

## Install

Not on npm yet. From source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yagizdo/karagoz.git
cd karagoz
npm install
npm run build          # writes dist/: cli.js and two chunks
node dist/cli.js devices
```

`npm link` puts `karagoz` on your `PATH`. The examples below use `karagoz`.

## Quick start

```sh
$ karagoz devices
{"devices":[{"id":"emulator-5554","platform":"android","kind":"emulator","state":"device","name":"Medium_Phone_API_36.1"}]}

$ karagoz tap --text Chrome
{"device":"emulator-5554","x":667.5,"y":2002.5,"element":{"class":"android.widget.TextView","text":"Chrome","contentDesc":"Chrome","clickable":true,"longClickable":true,"focusable":true,"bounds":[581,1905,754,2100]}}

$ karagoz key HOME
{"device":"emulator-5554","key":"KEYCODE_HOME","code":3}

$ karagoz screenshot --out home.png
{"path":"/Users/me/home.png","device":"emulator-5554","pixels":{"width":1080,"height":2400},"logical":{"width":411.42857142857144,"height":914.2857142857143},"scale":2.625,"safeArea":{"top":63,"right":0,"bottom":63,"left":0},"rotation":0}
```

`karagoz ui-tree` prints the screen's accessibility tree; `tap --text` above found its target in that tree.

## Concepts

### Device selection

Every command except `devices` works on one device, picked in this order:

1. `--device <id>`
2. the `KARAGOZ_DEVICE` environment variable
3. the `ANDROID_SERIAL` environment variable
4. the only listed device

A variable is ignored when anything above it is given; an empty one counts as unset. `KARAGOZ_DEVICE` names a device on either platform.

The value is matched against every listed id first, exactly: adb serials (`emulator-5554`) and, on macOS, the UDIDs of booted simulators. If no id matches, it is matched against every `name` that [`devices`](#devices) prints: an emulator's AVD name (`Medium_Phone_API_36.1`), a phone's model (`SM-S908N`) or a simulator's name (`iPhone 17 Pro`), exactly and case-sensitively. A name matched on both platforms is ambiguous; neither wins.

| Situation | Error |
| --- | --- |
| A value is given and nothing matches | `DEVICE_NOT_FOUND`, listing what is connected |
| No value, nothing connected | `NO_DEVICE` |
| No value and two or more devices listed (in any state), or a name that matches two entries: the same AVD listed as `emulator-5554` and `127.0.0.1:5555`, or two phones of the same model | `DEVICE_AMBIGUOUS` |
| The picked device is not in state `device` (`offline`, `unauthorized`, ...), or a simulator not `Booted` (`Booting`, `Shutting Down`) | `DEVICE_NOT_READY` |
| The picked device is an iOS simulator and the command does not run there yet: every command but `devices`, `screenshot` and `doctor` | `NOT_SUPPORTED` |

karagoz never guesses between devices. There is no config file.

On macOS every command that targets a device lists booted simulators next to adb's devices, in parallel. A missing `adb` or `simctl` means that platform has no devices. Any other failure of one listing stops the command, unless the value is an id the other platform listed: a hung simulator service makes a bare call fail with `SIMCTL_TIMEOUT` after 30 s. When nothing is listed and `adb` is missing, the error is `ADB_NOT_FOUND`.

A phone connected over Wi-Fi as well as USB is listed twice, once per serial, and its model matches both: pick it by serial then. Quote a `--device` value that contains spaces, as some mDNS serials do.

### Coordinates

`screenshot` pixels, `ui-tree` bounds and the `tap` / `swipe` coordinates share one space: physical pixels of the current screen orientation, origin top left. A node's `bounds` of `[581,1905,754,2100]` can be tapped at its center, `(667.5, 2002.5)`, and that point is the same pixel in the screenshot. Decimals are allowed. On an iOS simulator the screenshot is always the panel in portrait, whatever the interface orientation.

`screenshot` reports `scale` (physical pixels per density-independent pixel on Android, per point on iOS) and `logical` size so a caller can convert to dp or points.

### Accessibility tree first

To see the screen, read `ui-tree` before taking a screenshot. The tree is text a program can search, costs about a thousand to a few thousand tokens, and gives the bounds needed to tap. A screenshot is written to disk and returned as a path; the CLI never prints the image.

## Output and errors

Every command prints exactly one line of JSON on stdout and exits, except `mcp`, which speaks JSON-RPC on stdout until stdin closes ([MCP server](#mcp-server)).

- **Success:** the command's result object, exit code `0`.
- **Failure:** an error object, exit code `1`:

  ```json
  {"error":{"code":"DEVICE_NOT_FOUND","message":"device 'nosuch' from --device matches no device id or name. Listed: emulator-5554 (Medium_Phone_API_36.1)."}}
  ```

  The same message goes to stderr as `karagoz: <message>`. It can span more than one line when it quotes adb or Node output; the stdout line never does.

  `INSTALL_FAILED` and `UNINSTALL_FAILED` add a `reason` field with Android's own code for the failure:

  ```json
  {"error":{"code":"INSTALL_FAILED","message":"adb: failed to install /Users/me/app-v1.apk: Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_VERSION_DOWNGRADE: Downgrade detected: Update version code 1 is older than current 2]","reason":"INSTALL_FAILED_VERSION_DOWNGRADE"}}
  ```

  No other code has it.

Branch on `error.code`, not on the message. Messages are for people and can change.

stderr also carries adb's own notices on success, such as `* daemon started successfully` when the adb server was not running. That first call takes about 3 s longer.

`karagoz --version` prints the version as plain text (`0.0.0`) and exits `0`. It wins over any command: `karagoz devices --version` prints the version.

### Arguments

- Options can appear anywhere, before or after the command name. A repeated option keeps its last value.
- There are no short flags. A value that starts with `-` is read as an option: `--device=-x` passes it as a value, and a positional that starts with `-` goes after `--`, with options before it: `karagoz text --device emulator-5554 -- -5`.
- An empty value (`--out=`) is refused.
- An option the command does not take is refused: `'devices' does not take the option '--device'`.

All of these fail with `INVALID_ARGS` before any device is contacted.

### Error codes

The set is closed. Any failure without a code of its own is reported as `INTERNAL`.

| Code | Meaning | From |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NO_COMMAND` | No command given. The message lists the commands. | all |
| `UNKNOWN_COMMAND` | The command name is not known. | all |
| `INVALID_ARGS` | Missing, extra, malformed or unknown arguments, an unknown key name, an APK path that is not an existing `.apk` file, a screenshot `--out` that does not end in `.png`, a malformed package name, a `--since` that is not Unix time in seconds, or a `--lines` outside 1 to 999999999. | all |
| `ADB_NOT_FOUND` | No `adb` found. See [Requirements](#requirements). | all that reach adb, except `doctor`, which reports these in its output; `devices` reports them in `errors` when the other platform could be listed |
| `ADB_TIMEOUT` | adb did not answer in time: 10 s per call, 20 s for a `ui-tree` read, 10 s plus the duration for a long press or swipe, 30 s plus 1 s per started MB for `install`, 30 s for the start in `launch`. The message suggests `adb kill-server`; for `ui-tree` the cause is more often a stuck dump, and for `install` an install prompt on the phone, which the message names first. | all that reach adb, except `doctor`, which reports these in its output; `devices` reports them in `errors` when the other platform could be listed |
| `ADB_FAILED` | adb exited with an error. The message is adb's stderr, or Node's error when adb printed nothing. For `launch`, `terminate` and `uninstall` it can also be the error the device command printed. For `logs`, logcat's own error text or output that is not whole log records. A device that disconnects mid-command ends here. | all that reach adb, except `doctor`, which reports these in its output; `devices` reports them in `errors` when the other platform could be listed |
| `SIMCTL_NOT_FOUND` | No `simctl` found: Xcode is missing or was never opened, or `DEVELOPER_DIR` points somewhere without one. See [Requirements](#requirements). | `devices`, inside `errors`; `screenshot` on a simulator; on macOS, every command that targets a device (listing, see [Device selection](#device-selection)) |
| `SIMCTL_TIMEOUT` | simctl did not answer in 30 s. | `devices`, inside `errors`; `screenshot` on a simulator; on macOS, every command that targets a device (listing, see [Device selection](#device-selection)) |
| `SIMCTL_FAILED` | simctl exited with an error, or printed something that is not its device list. The message is simctl's stderr, or Node's error when simctl printed nothing; for unexpected output, `unexpected simctl output:` and its first line. | `devices`, inside `errors`; `screenshot` on a simulator; on macOS, every command that targets a device (listing, see [Device selection](#device-selection)) |
| `NO_DEVICE` | No device connected and none named. On macOS the message also names booting a simulator. | all but `devices` and `doctor` |
| `DEVICE_NOT_FOUND` | The named device is not connected. | all but `devices` and `doctor` |
| `DEVICE_AMBIGUOUS` | More than one device and none named, or a name that matches more than one. | all but `devices` and `doctor` |
| `DEVICE_NOT_READY` | The device is `offline`, `unauthorized` or similar, or the simulator is `Booting` or `Shutting Down`. | all but `devices` and `doctor` |
| `NOT_SUPPORTED` | The device is an iOS simulator and the command does not run there yet: `'ui-tree' does not run on iOS simulators yet`. Argument checks come first. | all but `devices`, `screenshot` and `doctor` |
| `CAPTURE_FAILED` | The screen could not be read: bad screenshot data, missing display info, or a uiautomator failure. The message says which. | `screenshot`, `ui-tree`, `tap --text/--id` |
| `AUTOMATION_BUSY` | Another UiAutomation client holds the device. | `ui-tree`, `tap --text/--id` |
| `WRITE_FAILED` | The screenshot file could not be written. | `screenshot` |
| `TEXT_UNSUPPORTED` | The text has a character Android's `input text` cannot type. | `text` |
| `ELEMENT_NOT_FOUND` | No node matches. | `tap --text/--id` |
| `ELEMENT_AMBIGUOUS` | More than one node matches. | `tap --text/--id` |
| `ELEMENT_COVERED` | The node's center is under the on-screen keyboard. | `tap --text/--id` |
| `INPUT_BLOCKED` | The device does not let adb inject input; on Xiaomi, Redmi and POCO, "USB debugging (Security settings)" is off; on vivo and iQOO, "USB simulated click". | `tap`, `swipe`, `text`, `key` |
| `INSTALL_FAILED` | Android refused the APK. `reason` is Android's code. | `install` |
| `UNINSTALL_FAILED` | Android refused to remove the app. `reason` is Android's code. | `uninstall` |
| `APP_NOT_FOUND` | The package is not installed. | `launch`, `terminate`, `uninstall`, `logs` |
| `APP_NOT_LAUNCHABLE` | The package is installed but has no activity a launcher can start. | `launch` |
| `INTERNAL` | A bug in karagoz. Please report it with the message. | all |

### devices

```
karagoz devices
```

Lists what `adb devices` lists and, on macOS, the iOS simulators that are running. Takes no options.

**Output**

```json
{"devices":[{"id":"emulator-5554","platform":"android","kind":"emulator","state":"device","name":"Medium_Phone_API_36.1"}]}
```

A phone on USB next to the emulator (serial masked):

```json
{"devices":[{"id":"XXXXXXXXXXX","platform":"android","kind":"physical","state":"device","name":"SM-S908N"},{"id":"emulator-5554","platform":"android","kind":"emulator","state":"device","name":"Medium_Phone_API_36.1"}]}
```

An iOS simulator running next to the emulator (macOS):

```json
{"devices":[{"id":"emulator-5554","platform":"android","kind":"emulator","state":"device","name":"Medium_Phone_API_36.1"},{"id":"4E70BFCA-5FC6-49B5-92EC-48E265B2D50F","platform":"ios","kind":"simulator","state":"Booted","name":"iPhone 17 Pro"}]}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | The adb serial, or the simulator's UDID. Pass it to `--device`. |
| `platform` | `"android"` or `"ios"` | |
| `kind` | `"emulator"`, `"physical"` or `"simulator"` | `simulator` for iOS simulators. `emulator` when the id is `emulator-<port>`, or when the device reports `ro.boot.qemu` or `ro.kernel.qemu` as `1`, or `ro.hardware` as `ranchu` or `goldfish` (an emulator attached with `adb connect`). Genymotion, and other ids not in state `device`, read as `physical`. |
| `state` | string | adb's state, unchanged: `device`, `offline`, `unauthorized`, ... Only `device` can be used. For simulators, simctl's state: `Booted`, `Booting`, `Shutting Down`; only `Booted` is usable. |
| `name` | string or `null` | The AVD name for emulators, the model (`ro.product.model`) for phones, the simulator's name for simulators. `null` when the device does not answer, or when it is not in state `device` and its id is not `emulator-<port>`. |

No devices is not an error: `{"devices":[]}`, exit `0`. Android devices come first in adb's order, then simulators in simctl's order.

If adb or simctl is missing, fails or hangs, the other platform is still listed, `errors` holds one `{"platform","code","message"}` per failed platform, and the exit is `0`. When every platform tried fails, Android's error is printed as the usual envelope and the exit is `1`. On Linux and Windows simulators are not looked for.

**Errors:** `INVALID_ARGS`, `ADB_NOT_FOUND`, `ADB_TIMEOUT`, `ADB_FAILED`; `SIMCTL_NOT_FOUND`, `SIMCTL_TIMEOUT`, `SIMCTL_FAILED` inside `errors` only.

**Notes**

- About 55 ms, plus about 50 ms per emulator for its name, asked in parallel. A device whose id is not `emulator-<port>` costs one more call in parallel, a chained `getprop` of about 135 ms. With a phone on USB and one emulator, the whole `karagoz devices` run took 257 to 289 ms (three runs, macOS).
- On macOS the simulator listing runs in parallel with adb and takes about 0.12 s once the simulator service runs. The first call after login can take several seconds while macOS starts that service (30 s limit).
- Shut-down simulators, and watchOS, tvOS and visionOS simulators, are not listed.
- A device listed as `(no serial number)`, or two devices that share one serial, cannot be targeted: adb's `-s` cannot tell them apart.
- karagoz does not pair or connect over Wi-Fi. Use `adb pair` and `adb connect`; a paired Android 11+ phone reconnects by itself.
- If an emulator's name comes back `null`, check that `HOME` points to your home directory; the emulator console reads a token from there.

### screenshot

```
karagoz screenshot [--out <path>] [--device <id>]
```

Saves the screen as a PNG at full device resolution, never scaled, and prints where it went with the metadata needed to measure against it. Runs on an Android emulator, an Android device and, on macOS, a booted iOS simulator.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--out <path>` | a new file under the temp directory | Where to write the PNG; must end in `.png`. |
| `--device <id>` | see [Device selection](#device-selection) | An adb serial, a simulator's UDID, or a name. |

**Output**

```json
{"path":"/Users/me/home.png","device":"emulator-5554","pixels":{"width":1080,"height":2400},"logical":{"width":411.42857142857144,"height":914.2857142857143},"scale":2.625,"safeArea":{"top":63,"right":0,"bottom":63,"left":0},"rotation":0}
```

An iPhone 17 Pro simulator (macOS), without `--out`:

```json
{"path":"/var/folders/.../T/karagoz/4E70BFCA-5FC6-49B5-92EC-48E265B2D50F-20261006T182312310Z.png","device":"4E70BFCA-5FC6-49B5-92EC-48E265B2D50F","pixels":{"width":1206,"height":2622},"logical":{"width":402,"height":874},"scale":3,"safeArea":null,"rotation":null}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `path` | string | Absolute path of the PNG. |
| `device` | string | The adb serial or the simulator's UDID. |
| `pixels` | `{width, height}` | Size of the PNG, read from the file itself. |
| `logical` | `{width, height}` | `pixels / scale`, not rounded. |
| `scale` | number | Android: density / 160, using the override density if one is set (`adb shell wm density`). iOS: the simulator's `SIMULATOR_MAINSCREEN_SCALE`, except `2.88` (1080 / 375) for a 1080x2340 PNG (iPhone 12 mini, 13 mini): the simulator reports 3 there, but apps lay out 375 points wide. |
| `safeArea` | `{top, right, bottom, left}` or `null` | Pixels of this PNG covered by the status bar, navigation bar, caption bar or display cutout. A hidden bar counts as 0. The keyboard and gesture areas are not included. `null` on iOS: only the app itself can read its safe area, and the simulator exposes no other source. |
| `rotation` | `0`, `90`, `180`, `270` or `null` | Screen rotation in degrees. `null` on iOS: the interface orientation cannot be read from outside the simulator. |

On iOS the PNG is the simulator's panel in portrait, exactly as simctl encoded it; karagoz does not rotate or re-encode it. A landscape app's UI is drawn sideways in it. The corners are square, not rounded, and the Dynamic Island area is black pixels.

**File location**

- Without `--out`: `<temp dir>/karagoz/<device id>-<UTC timestamp>.png`, where the device id is a UDID on iOS, for example `/var/folders/.../T/karagoz/emulator-5554-20260926T101530123Z.png`. The temp directory follows `TMPDIR`. The `karagoz` directory is created private to your user (mode 0700) and must be a real directory you own; the file is created with mode 0600 and never overwrites. Characters other than letters, digits, `.`, `_` and `-` in the device id become `_`.
- With `--out`: the path must end in `.png`, in any case, or the command fails with `INVALID_ARGS` before any device call. Relative paths resolve against the current directory, missing parent directories are created, and an existing `.png` is overwritten.
- karagoz never deletes screenshots. One 1080x2400 capture is about 1.4 MB; one 1206x2622 simulator capture about 2.9 MB.

**Errors**

- `CAPTURE_FAILED`: screencap returned something other than a whole PNG (its message is included); the density, display size, rotation or insets could not be read (`cannot read <value> from <command>`); or the screen rotated or resized during the capture (`display is WxH but the screenshot is WxH`). With more than one display, screencap's warning comes back as `CAPTURE_FAILED`. On iOS: simctl printed something other than a whole PNG (its text, or `simctl returned no image data`), or the scale could not be read (`cannot read scale from 'simctl getenv' (got '<value>')`).
- `SIMCTL_FAILED`: on iOS the capture failed; the message is simctl's text. The first capture right after a boot can fail with `Error creating the image`. `SIMCTL_TIMEOUT` after 30 s, `SIMCTL_NOT_FOUND` without Xcode.
- `WRITE_FAILED`: the file could not be written, or the default directory is not yours (`pass --out`). Two captures of one device in the same millisecond without `--out`: the second fails.
- `INVALID_ARGS`: `'<absolute path>' is not a .png file` for an `--out` that does not end in `.png`, before any device call.
- Plus the [device selection](#device-selection) errors (`NOT_SUPPORTED` excepted), the other `INVALID_ARGS` cases and the adb errors.

**Notes**

- About 1 s on the emulator, about 0.5 s on a phone over USB, about 0.6 s on a simulator.
- A screen that is off, or an app that sets `FLAG_SECURE`, gives a black PNG and exit `0`. Some Android 14 builds refuse the capture instead while a `FLAG_SECURE` window or the lock screen's PIN pad is showing: `CAPTURE_FAILED` with `screencap returned no data`.
- If the density changes during a capture, `scale` and `safeArea` can disagree for that one capture.

### ui-tree

```
karagoz ui-tree [--device <id>]
```

Returns the accessibility tree of the focused window, read with `uiautomator dump`.

**Output** (children cut short here; the real tree nests the Chrome icon several levels deep)

```json
{"device":"emulator-5554","rotation":0,"root":{"class":"android.widget.FrameLayout","package":"com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher","bounds":[0,0,1080,2400],"children":[...]}}
```

A node from the same tree:

```json
{"class":"android.widget.TextView","text":"Chrome","contentDesc":"Chrome","clickable":true,"longClickable":true,"focusable":true,"bounds":[581,1905,754,2100]}
```

| Field | Present | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `device` | always | Serial. |
| `rotation` | always | `0`, `90`, `180` or `270`. |
| `root` | always | The top node. |

Node fields, in this order:

| Field | Present | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `class` | always | Android class, e.g. `android.widget.Button`. Can be empty. |
| `package` | on the root, and on any node whose package differs from its parent's | App package. |
| `text`, `contentDesc`, `resourceId`, `hint` | when not empty | `resourceId` is the full form, `com.example:id/save`. `hint` exists from Android 15 QPR2 (some API 35 images) on. |
| `checkable`, `checked`, `clickable`, `longClickable`, `focusable`, `focused`, `scrollable`, `selected`, `password` | only when `true` | |
| `enabled` | only when `false` | |
| `bounds` | always | `[left, top, right, bottom]` in [screen pixels](#coordinates). Clipped to the screen: a node wholly off screen is `[0,0,0,0]`, and bottom can be above top. Up to Android 13 the clip also leaves out the status and navigation bars, so a node in the bottom band can be `[0,0,0,0]` while it is visible. |
| `children` | when the node has any | Nodes, same shape. |

Other attributes that uiautomator prints (`index`, `drawing-order`, `NAF`) are dropped. Every node uiautomator returns is kept; there is no filtering.

What the tree covers is what uiautomator covers: the focused window, and nodes visible to the user. Where a framework puts its labels differs: Jetpack Compose puts text in `text`, Flutter puts it in `contentDesc`.

**WebView:** a WebView's content often arrives only on the second read. When the tree has a WebView with no children, karagoz reads once more and returns the second tree, or the first if the second read fails.

**Errors**

- `CAPTURE_FAILED`, with the reason in the message:
  - the screen kept changing for uiautomator's 10 s idle wait (an animation or live content);
  - no focused window (the screen is off, an app is still starting, or the app is in a work profile or Secure Folder, which adb cannot read);
  - uiautomator was killed (the message names `adb -s <id> logcat -b crash`); a lone UTF-16 surrogate in on-screen text does this;
  - the output could not be parsed.
- `AUTOMATION_BUSY`: another UiAutomation client is connected. Only one can be at a time.
- `ADB_TIMEOUT` after 20 s.
- Plus the [device selection](#device-selection) errors, `INVALID_ARGS` and the adb errors.

**Notes**

- One read takes 2.4 to 3.3 s; a screen with a fresh WebView about 5.3 s. The idle failure arrives after about 12 s.
- Output size on the screens measured was about 900 to 6,200 tokens.
- While a read runs, accessibility services such as TalkBack are unbound, and apps see accessibility as enabled. A service that requests the accessibility button is taken off the button and shortcut and stays off; add it back in the accessibility settings.

### tap

```
karagoz tap <x> <y> [--duration <ms>] [--device <id>]
karagoz tap --text <label> [--timeout <ms>] [--duration <ms>] [--device <id>]
karagoz tap --id <resource-id> [--timeout <ms>] [--duration <ms>] [--device <id>]
```

Taps a point, or finds one node in the [tree](#ui-tree) and taps its center. Give exactly one of `<x> <y>`, `--text` or `--id`.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<x> <y>` | | A point in [screen pixels](#coordinates). Non-negative, decimals allowed (`12`, `12.5`). |
| `--text <label>` | | A node whose `text` or `contentDesc` equals the label: whole string, case-sensitive, no trimming. Invisible direction marks (U+200E and the like) are ignored on both sides. |
| `--id <resource-id>` | | A node whose `resourceId` equals the value, or ends with `:id/<value>`. `--id save` matches `com.example:id/save`. |
| `--duration <ms>` | none | Hold for this long (a long press). Whole milliseconds, 0 to 999999999. |
| `--timeout <ms>` | `0` | Keep reading the tree until a node matches or this much time has passed. Only with `--text` or `--id`. |
| `--device <id>` | see [Device selection](#device-selection) | |

**Output**

Point:

```json
{"device":"emulator-5554","x":540,"y":1200}
```

With `--duration 10` a `"duration":10` field follows `y`. Node:

```json
{"device":"emulator-5554","x":667.5,"y":2002.5,"element":{"class":"android.widget.TextView","text":"Chrome","contentDesc":"Chrome","clickable":true,"longClickable":true,"focusable":true,"bounds":[581,1905,754,2100]}}
```

`element` is the matched node as [`ui-tree`](#ui-tree) returns it, without `children`. `x` and `y` are its center.

**How a node is found**

- The tap goes to the center of the node that matched, not to a clickable parent. Measured on View, Compose and Flutter test apps, the center of the matched node receives the click.
- A parent and a child that both match are two matches: `ELEMENT_AMBIGUOUS`. Pick one and tap its coordinates.
- Nodes with zero-size bounds never match.
- If the keyboard is visible and the node's center is inside it, the tap is refused with `ELEMENT_COVERED`. Close the keyboard with `karagoz key BACK`. Only the keyboard is checked; bubbles and picture-in-picture windows are not.
- With `--timeout`, only "no match" triggers another read, and it starts right away. The last read can end up to one read (about 3 s) past the timeout. The tap itself is never repeated.
- The screen can change between the read and the tap; the tap then lands on the old point.
- A long press with `--duration` is sent as a swipe that does not move. View and Compose use the device's long-press setting (`settings get secure long_press_timeout`; 400 ms on stock Android, Samsung offers 300 to 1500 ms), Flutter 500 ms.

**Errors**

- `INVALID_ARGS`: no target or more than one (`'tap' takes <x> <y>, --text or --id`), a single coordinate (`'tap' needs <x> <y>`), `--timeout` with a point, or a malformed number.
- `ELEMENT_NOT_FOUND`: `no node with text or contentDesc 'Save' in com.example (1 read in 2.6 s)`.
- `ELEMENT_AMBIGUOUS`: lists up to five matches with class and bounds.
- `ELEMENT_COVERED`: the node is under the keyboard.
- Node taps also get every [`ui-tree`](#ui-tree) error. A point tap does not read the tree, so it works while another UiAutomation client is connected.
- Plus `INPUT_BLOCKED`, the [device selection](#device-selection) errors and the adb errors.

**Notes**

- A point tap takes about 0.2 s. A node tap adds one tree read, 2.5 to 3.3 s.
- Points are not checked against the screen size.
- Exit `0` means Android accepted the event, not that the app reacted to it. Read the tree again to check.

### swipe

```
karagoz swipe <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2> [--duration <ms>] [--device <id>]
```

Moves one finger from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)`.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<x1> <y1> <x2> <y2>` | | [Screen pixels](#coordinates), same rules as `tap`. |
| `--duration <ms>` | `300` | Time from start to end. Whole milliseconds, 0 to 999999999. |
| `--device <id>` | see [Device selection](#device-selection) | |

**Output**

```json
{"device":"emulator-5554","x1":540,"y1":1800,"x2":540,"y2":600,"duration":300}
```

`duration` is always present, including the default.

**Duration matters.** A fast swipe flings a list and a slow one drags it. Measured on a 1200 px drag: 300 ms scrolled a further 1059 px after the finger lifted, 1000 ms scrolled 131 px further, 3000 ms 19 px.

**Errors:** `INVALID_ARGS`, `INPUT_BLOCKED`, the [device selection](#device-selection) errors and the adb errors.

### text

```
karagoz text <text> [--device <id>]
karagoz text [--device <id>] -- <text starting with ->
```

Types into whatever has focus, as Android's `input text` does.

**Output**

```json
{"device":"emulator-5554","text":"hello"}
```

**Characters.** Printable ASCII, newline (sent as Enter), tab (sent as Tab), `ç`, `Ç` and `ß`. Anything else fails before anything is typed:

```json
{"error":{"code":"TEXT_UNSUPPORTED","message":"cannot type 'ü' (U+00FC): Android's input text types only printable ASCII, newline, tab, ç, Ç and ß; nothing was typed"}}
```

Quotes, spaces and `%s` are typed as they are; karagoz handles the escaping.

**Errors**

- `INVALID_ARGS`: empty text.
- `TEXT_UNSUPPORTED`: see above.
- Long text is sent in pieces of up to 100 characters. If a piece fails, the error keeps its code and the message ends with `; <n> of <total> characters were typed before this`.
- Plus `INPUT_BLOCKED`, the [device selection](#device-selection) errors and the adb errors.

**Notes**

- Characters typed right after a field appears can be lost. Waiting about 2 s after the field shows up fixed it in testing.
- 100 characters take about 0.9 s.

### key

```
karagoz key <key> [--device <id>]
```

Presses one key.

`<key>` is an Android [KeyEvent](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent) name or code:

- A name, case-insensitive, with or without `KEYCODE_`: `HOME`, `back`, `KEYCODE_ENTER`, `VOLUME_UP`.
- A number from 1 to 340 is a key code: `key 3` is `HOME`. To press the digit 7, use `KEYCODE_7`, because `key 7` is code 7, which is `KEYCODE_0`.

**Output**

```json
{"device":"emulator-5554","key":"KEYCODE_HOME","code":3}
```

`key` is the resolved name and `code` its number.

**Errors**

- `INVALID_ARGS`: `unknown key 'FOO'; use a KeyEvent name such as HOME, BACK or ENTER, or a code from 1 to 340`. Checked before any device call.
- Plus `INPUT_BLOCKED`, the [device selection](#device-selection) errors and the adb errors.

**Notes**

- A device knows the key codes of its Android version only (12: up to 288, 13: 304, 14: 316, 15: 318, 16: 337); a higher code is sent as `KEYCODE_UNKNOWN`, still with exit `0`.
- Some keys act on the whole device: code 312 opens Recents, 318 saves a screenshot.
- Exit `0` means Android accepted the key, not that the app reacted to it.

### install

```
karagoz install <apk> [--device <id>]
```

Installs an app from one APK file, or replaces the installed version of the same app.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<apk>` | | Path to an `.apk` file. A relative path is resolved against the current directory. |
| `--device <id>` | see [Device selection](#device-selection) | |

**Output**

```json
{"device":"emulator-5554","path":"/Users/me/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk"}
```

`path` is the absolute path of the APK, as given (symlinks are not followed). The package name is not reported.

**Errors**

- `INVALID_ARGS`: `'<path>' is not an .apk file`, `no file at '<path>'` or `'<path>' is not a file`. Checked before any device call.
- `INSTALL_FAILED`: Android refused the APK. The message is adb's, and `reason` is Android's code, as in the [example above](#output-and-errors). Codes seen on the emulator: `INSTALL_FAILED_VERSION_DOWNGRADE` (a lower `versionCode` than the installed app), `INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE` (signed with another key), `INSTALL_PARSE_FAILED_NOT_APK`, `INSTALL_FAILED_DEPRECATED_SDK_VERSION` (`targetSdkVersion` below 24 on Android 16).
- On a phone, Android's code can come from the phone's own install check, with text that says someone cancelled when nobody did: `INSTALL_FAILED_VERIFICATION_FAILURE` (Play Protect refused the app), `INSTALL_FAILED_USER_RESTRICTED` with `Install canceled by user` (Xiaomi, Redmi, POCO: "Install via USB" is off, or its prompt ran out), `INSTALL_FAILED_ABORTED` with `User rejected permissions` (vivo, iQOO: the same).
- A failure without an Android code, such as `Error: device is still booting.`, stays `ADB_FAILED`.
- `ADB_TIMEOUT` after 30 s plus 1 s for every started MB of the APK. On a phone, the install may be held on a prompt (Play Protect, or the maker's check for USB installs) that waits for a tap; if it is accepted later, the app still installs.
- Plus the [device selection](#device-selection) errors and the adb errors.

**Notes**

- Runs `adb install -r --no-incremental`. Since Android 9 a reinstall replaces the app without `-r`; it stays for older devices. `--no-incremental` matters when an `.idsig` file sits next to the APK (`apksigner` writes one by default): adb would then install incrementally, through a background `adb inc-server` process.
- One `.apk` only. Split APKs, `.apks` and `.aab` are not supported. There is no way to pass `-g` (grant runtime permissions), `-d` (allow a downgrade) or `-t`: an APK marked `testOnly`, which Android Studio's Run button can produce, fails with `INSTALL_FAILED_TEST_ONLY`.
- Android installs the app for every user on the device that allows adb installs; Secure Folder, Dual Messenger and work profiles get it too.
- An 8.5 KB APK took 0.7 s, a 100 MB one 2.5 to 3.4 s.

### launch

```
karagoz launch <package> [--device <id>]
```

Starts an app the way tapping its launcher icon does.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<package>` | | The package name, such as `com.android.settings`. |
| `--device <id>` | see [Device selection](#device-selection) | |

**Output**

```json
{"device":"emulator-5554","package":"com.android.settings","activity":"com.android.settings/.homepage.SettingsHomepageActivity"}
```

`activity` is the activity Android reports as started, in its `package/.Class` short form, or `null` when Android names none. It is not always the launcher activity:

- Settings' launcher activity `.Settings` hands off to `.homepage.SettingsHomepageActivity`, and that one is reported.
- If the app's task is already running, it comes to the front as it is, and its top activity is reported, even one from another package. With the Settings search open, `launch com.android.settings` reports `com.google.android.settings.intelligence/.modules.search.activity.SearchActivity`.

**Which activity is started.** Android's own rule for launch intents: the first activity with the `MAIN` action and the `INFO` category, otherwise the first with `MAIN` and `LAUNCHER`. With two launcher activities the first one Android lists is started; no chooser appears.

**Errors**

- `INVALID_ARGS`: `'<value>' is not a package name`. A package name is letters, digits and `_`, in dot-separated parts that each start with a letter. Checked before any device call.
- `APP_NOT_FOUND`: `package 'dev.karagoz.nope' is not installed on emulator-5554`.
- `APP_NOT_LAUNCHABLE`: `package 'com.android.shell' has no launcher activity`.
- `ADB_FAILED`: Android refused the start. The message is Android's `Error:` line, such as `Error: Activity class {com.example/com.example.Main} does not exist.`
- `ADB_TIMEOUT` after 30 s. Android itself gives up after 10 s for a process to start and 10 s for the activity to settle.
- Plus the [device selection](#device-selection) errors and the adb errors.

**Notes**

- Exit `0` means Android started the activity, not that the app is up. An app that crashes at start, and a start with the screen off, also exit `0`. Read the [tree](#ui-tree) to check.
- Nothing is restarted or cleared. For a fresh start, run [`terminate`](#terminate) first.
- A cold start of a small app took 1.7 to 2.0 s.

### terminate

```
karagoz terminate <package> [--device <id>]
```

Stops an app with `am force-stop`: every process of the package is killed before the command returns, and Android removes its alarms, scheduled jobs and notifications.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<package>` | | The package name. |
| `--device <id>` | see [Device selection](#device-selection) | |

**Output**

```json
{"device":"emulator-5554","package":"com.android.settings"}
```

An app that is installed but not running gives the same output.

**Errors**

- `INVALID_ARGS`: `'<value>' is not a package name`, as for [`launch`](#launch).
- `APP_NOT_FOUND`: the package is not installed. `am force-stop` alone says nothing in that case, so karagoz checks first.
- `ADB_FAILED`: `am force-stop` printed an error; the message is that error.
- Plus the [device selection](#device-selection) errors and the adb errors.

**Notes**

- Only the package's own processes stop. An activity from another package in the same task stays on screen: after `terminate com.android.settings` with the Settings search open, the search is still in front.
- The app stops in every user on the device, Secure Folder and work profiles included.
- Took 0.8 to 1.3 s.

### uninstall

```
karagoz uninstall <package> [--device <id>]
```

Removes an app and its data.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<package>` | | The package name. |
| `--device <id>` | see [Device selection](#device-selection) | |

**Output**

```json
{"device":"emulator-5554","package":"dev.karagoz.smoke"}
```

**Errors**

- `INVALID_ARGS`: `'<value>' is not a package name`, as for [`launch`](#launch).
- `APP_NOT_FOUND`: the package is not installed. Checked first, because Android answers a missing package with `DELETE_FAILED_INTERNAL_ERROR`, the same code it gives for a package it will not remove.
- `UNINSTALL_FAILED`: Android refused. The message is Android's `Failure [...]` line and `reason` its code, such as `DELETE_FAILED_INTERNAL_ERROR` for a system app with no updates.
- Plus the [device selection](#device-selection) errors and the adb errors.

**Notes**

- A system app with installed updates goes back to its factory version. Android reports that as success, and so does karagoz.
- The app's data is always removed; `adb uninstall -k` (keep data) is not offered.
- The app and its data go from every user on the device, Secure Folder and work profiles included. The installed check looks at the main user only, so an app installed only in a profile gives `APP_NOT_FOUND`.
- Took 0.6 to 0.8 s.

### logs

```
karagoz logs [--package <package>] [--since <seconds>] [--lines <n>] [--device <id>]
```

Reads the device log once and prints the newest records as JSON. Each record is whole: a stack trace is one record with newlines in its message, not one entry per line.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--package <package>` | all records | Keep only the records written under this package's Linux user id (uid) in the main Android user. |
| `--since <seconds>` | the whole log | Unix time in seconds on the device clock, up to 9 decimals and at most 4294967295. Only records stamped later are read. |
| `--lines <n>` | `30` | How many of the newest matching records to return, 1 to 999999999. |
| `--device <id>` | see [Device selection](#device-selection) | |

**Output**

```json
{"device":"emulator-5554","package":"com.android.shell","uid":2000,"records":[{"time":1790521762.474251,"pid":24931,"tid":24931,"level":"I","tag":"KaragozManual","message":"hello from karagoz"}],"omitted":0}
```

That record was written with `adb shell log -t KaragozManual "hello from karagoz"`; `adb shell` runs as `com.android.shell`.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `device` | string | Serial of the device read. |
| `package` | string | Only with `--package`: the package as given. |
| `uid` | number | Only with `--package`: the uid the records were matched on. `com.android.settings` has 1000, which it shares with the system server. |
| `records` | array | The matching records, at most `--lines`, oldest first in the order the device's log daemon received them. |
| `records[].time` | number | When the record was written: seconds since the Unix epoch on the device clock, to the microsecond, rounded up. |
| `records[].pid`, `records[].tid` | number | Process and thread that wrote it. |
| `records[].level` | string | `V`, `D`, `I`, `W`, `E` or `F`; `?` for any other priority. |
| `records[].tag` | string | The log tag. |
| `records[].message` | string | The message, newlines kept. |
| `omitted` | number | How many older matching records `--lines` left out. `0` when `records` holds every match. |

An empty `records` with `omitted` `0` means nothing matched. It is not an error.

**Reading since your last call.** Pass the largest `time` of one result as the next `--since` to get only newer records. The rounding up makes this exact: no record comes back in the next call. After the call above:

```
karagoz logs --package com.android.shell --since 1790521762.474251
```

```json
{"device":"emulator-5554","package":"com.android.shell","uid":2000,"records":[],"omitted":0}
```

Take the largest `time`, not the last record's: records are in arrival order, and times can step back by a few milliseconds.

**Errors**

- `INVALID_ARGS`: `'<value>' is not a package name`, as for [`launch`](#launch); `--since must be Unix time in seconds (got '<value>')`; `--lines must be a whole number from 1 to 999999999 (got '<value>')`. Checked before any device call.
- `APP_NOT_FOUND`: `package 'dev.karagoz.missing' is not installed on emulator-5554`.
- `ADB_FAILED`: logcat printed its own error instead of records, such as `Failed to wait for logd.ready to become true. logd not running?`; the output was not whole log records; or `pm list packages` printed an error while karagoz looked up the uid. The message is that output, cut at 300 characters. A log larger than the 64 MB karagoz reads at once is `ADB_FAILED` too, with a message that says to pass `--since`.
- `ADB_TIMEOUT` after 10 s.
- Plus the [device selection](#device-selection) errors and the adb errors.

**Notes**

- Logs read: main, system and crash, plus kernel from Android 11, logcat's defaults. The events log is not read.
- The log is never cleared, resized or reconfigured, so other tools and the user keep their history. A call reads what is there and exits; nothing streams. To wait for a line, call again with `--since`.
- The whole window is read from the device and filtered on the host, because logcat counts records before it filters by uid. A full log on the test emulator was 26 MB, about 133,000 records: `logs --lines 1` took 0.7 s, 0.8 s with `--package`. The default 30 records come to about 7 KB of JSON on average; over every 30-record window of a 141,000-record log, the largest was 47 KB.
- `--package` matches the uid, not a process: every process of the app, every restart, and its Java and native crash lines. Lines the system server writes about the app, such as `Start proc` and `ANR in`, have uid 1000 and are not included. A package that shares a system uid, such as Settings, gets the other processes of that uid as well.
- `--package` reads the app in the main Android user. Its copies in Secure Folder, a work profile or a second instance (Dual Messenger, Dual Apps) run under another uid and are not included.
- A record stamped at or before `--since` that the log daemon receives after the previous read is returned by neither call. Records arrived up to 54 ms late in testing.
- `--since` is on the device clock, which can differ from the computer's: a phone ran 10 s behind with automatic time on, so a computer timestamp skipped every new record. Pass a `time` from an earlier result.
- A missing line does not prove the app did not write it: some phones drop lines before they reach the log. A `log.tag` property of `I` (`adb shell getprop log.tag`) drops `D` and `V` lines, Developer options' "Logger buffer sizes: Off" drops nearly all, and Huawei and Honor phones keep app logs off until "AP Log" is turned on in a hidden menu.
- Android cuts a record's tag and message at 4068 bytes together when it is written. Bytes that are not valid UTF-8 become U+FFFD.
- From Android 15 the device ends a read after 5 s without data and still exits `0`, so a read cut short looks complete.

### doctor

```
karagoz doctor
```

Reports which `adb` karagoz uses, its version, every other `adb` it could use, and how to install platform-tools when adb is missing or too old. It changes nothing. No options.

**Output**

```json
{"adb":{"status":"ok","source":"PATH","path":"/opt/homebrew/bin/adb","version":"37.0.0-14910828","candidates":[{"source":"ANDROID_HOME","status":"unset"},{"source":"ANDROID_SDK_ROOT","status":"unset"},{"source":"PATH","status":"ok","path":"/opt/homebrew/bin/adb","version":"37.0.0-14910828"},{"source":"default","status":"ok","path":"/Users/me/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb","version":"36.0.2-14143358"}]}}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `adb.status` | string | `ok`, `outdated` or `failed`: the status of the candidate karagoz uses. `missing`: no candidate can be used. |
| `adb.source`, `adb.path`, `adb.version`, `adb.message` | string | Copied from the candidate karagoz uses, when it has them. |
| `adb.install` | string | Only when `status` is not `ok`: how to install platform-tools on this OS, the same text `ADB_NOT_FOUND` prints. |
| `adb.candidates` | array | The four places karagoz looks, in lookup order (see [Requirements](#requirements)). |
| `candidates[].source` | string | `ANDROID_HOME`, `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`, `PATH`, or `default` for Android Studio's default SDK. |
| `candidates[].status` | string | See below. |
| `candidates[].path` | string | When known: the file karagoz would run. For `PATH`, the path adb prints for itself in `adb version`, so it is absent when adb printed none; on Windows, the `adb.exe` found on `PATH`. |
| `candidates[].version` | string | With `ok` and `outdated`: the `Version` line of `adb version`, as printed. |
| `candidates[].message` | string | With `failed` and `outdated`: why, cut at 300 characters. |

| Status | Means |
| --- | --- |
| `ok` | `adb version` exited `0` and reported platform-tools 30.0.0 or newer. |
| `outdated` | `adb version` exited `0` and reported a version below 30.0.0. |
| `failed` | Something is there but cannot be used: it did not start, exited non-zero, did not answer within 10 s, or printed no `Version` line. The message says which. |
| `missing` | Nothing at that location. For `PATH`: no `adb` on `PATH`, or on macOS and Linux only ones that fail to start with `ENOENT` (see Notes). |
| `unset` | No location to check: the variable is unset or empty. For `default`: Windows without `LOCALAPPDATA`. |

The exit code is `0` whenever the report is printed, with adb missing or broken as well. Check `adb.status`.

**Errors:** `INVALID_ARGS` for any argument or option (`'doctor' does not take the option '--device'`), `INTERNAL`.

**Notes**

- Only `adb version` runs, on every candidate at once. It never connects to the adb server, so server trouble does not show up here; the other commands report it as `ADB_TIMEOUT`.
- Nothing is installed.
- `outdated` means below platform-tools 30.0.0, where `install` fails: it passes `--no-incremental`, which older versions forward to the device, and the device rejects it. Debian 12 ships 29.0.6. The other commands still work.
- `version` keeps the builder's suffix: digits from Google, `-debian`, `-android-tools`. Debian's 8.1.0 package prints its package version, `1:8.1.0+r23-8`, and is `outdated`. `1.0.41` in `Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.41` is adb's protocol number and is not shown.
- For `PATH`, `path` is the symlink as invoked on macOS (`/opt/homebrew/bin/adb`) and the resolved file on Linux.
- A candidate that is there but fails to start with `ENOENT` (a script whose interpreter is missing, a broken link) is shown `failed`, and karagoz moves on to the next one, as every command does. Any other failure stops the lookup at that candidate. The exception is `PATH` on macOS and Linux: `adb` runs by name there, the error does not say which file failed, and the candidate is shown `missing`.
- An invalid `ANDROID_ADB_SERVER_PORT` makes `adb version` itself fail, so every `adb` found is `failed` with adb's message: `adb: $ANDROID_ADB_SERVER_PORT must be a positive number less than 65535: got "abc"`.
- Took 0.1 s with two adbs; 1.4 s on a cold first run. A candidate that hangs costs 10 s, and the others run meanwhile.
- Windows and Linux were not run.

## MCP server

```
karagoz mcp
```

Starts an MCP server for an AI agent on stdin and stdout. It opens no port: the client starts the process and talks to it over stdio. The 13 commands are its tools, and each tool returns the JSON line the CLI prints. The server code loads only when `mcp` runs, so the other commands start as fast as before.

`mcp` takes no arguments or options. It exits when stdin closes, or on SIGINT or SIGTERM.

### Registration

karagoz is not on npm yet, so every example runs the built file by its absolute path. After the first release, `npx -y karagoz mcp` replaces `node /abs/path/karagoz/dist/cli.js mcp`.

Claude Code and Codex were run against this server. The Claude Desktop, Cursor and VS Code entries follow their documentation and were not run.

**Claude Code**

```sh
claude mcp add karagoz -- node /abs/path/karagoz/dist/cli.js mcp
```

The server starts in the directory `claude` started in, with the shell's environment. A call still running after 2 minutes becomes a background task.

**Claude Desktop**, in `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` on Windows; quit and restart Desktop after editing:

```json
{"mcpServers":{"karagoz":{"command":"node","args":["/abs/path/karagoz/dist/cli.js","mcp"],"env":{"ANDROID_HOME":"/Users/me/Library/Android/sdk"}}}}
```

Desktop starts servers with part of your environment and possibly `/` as the working directory, so set `ANDROID_HOME` in `env` when `adb` is not on the `PATH` it passes, and use absolute paths.

**Cursor**, in `.cursor/mcp.json` in the project or `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{"mcpServers":{"karagoz":{"type":"stdio","command":"node","args":["/abs/path/karagoz/dist/cli.js","mcp"]}}}
```

**VS Code**, in `.vscode/mcp.json` in the workspace:

```json
{"servers":{"karagoz":{"type":"stdio","command":"node","args":["/abs/path/karagoz/dist/cli.js","mcp"]}}}
```

or from the command line: `code --add-mcp '{"name":"karagoz","command":"node","args":["/abs/path/karagoz/dist/cli.js","mcp"]}'`.

**Codex**, in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.karagoz]
command = "node"
args = ["/abs/path/karagoz/dist/cli.js", "mcp"]
env_vars = ["ANDROID_HOME", "ANDROID_SDK_ROOT", "KARAGOZ_DEVICE", "ANDROID_SERIAL"]
tool_timeout_sec = 600
```

Codex passes a server only a short list of environment variables; `env_vars` forwards the ones karagoz reads. `tool_timeout_sec` covers long `tap` waits and big installs. `install` and `uninstall` ask for approval; `codex exec`, which never asks, refuses them with `MCP tool call requires approval, but approval policy is never`.

### Tools

| Tool | Command | Arguments | Marked |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `devices` | [`devices`](#devices) | none | read-only |
| `screenshot` | [`screenshot`](#screenshot) | `out`, `inline`, `device` | |
| `ui_tree` | [`ui-tree`](#ui-tree) | `device` | read-only |
| `tap` | [`tap`](#tap) | `x`, `y`, `text`, `id`, `duration`, `timeout`, `device` | |
| `swipe` | [`swipe`](#swipe) | `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` (required), `duration`, `device` | |
| `text` | [`text`](#text) | `text` (required), `device` | |
| `key` | [`key`](#key) | `key` (required), `device` | |
| `install` | [`install`](#install-1) | `apk` (required), `device` | destructive |
| `launch` | [`launch`](#launch) | `package` (required), `device` | |
| `terminate` | [`terminate`](#terminate) | `package` (required), `device` | |
| `uninstall` | [`uninstall`](#uninstall) | `package` (required), `device` | destructive |
| `logs` | [`logs`](#logs) | `package`, `since`, `lines`, `device` | read-only |
| `doctor` | [`doctor`](#doctor) | none | read-only |

"Marked" is the tool's annotation: `readOnlyHint` or `destructiveHint`. The other seven carry `destructiveHint: false`, and all 13 carry `openWorldHint: false` and a title. Clients use these to decide what needs approval and what may run in parallel.

### Arguments

- The names are the CLI's option and positional names: `tap {"x": 540, "y": 1200}` is `karagoz tap 540 1200`, and `logs {"lines": 5}` is `karagoz logs --lines 5`. `ui_tree` is the one renamed tool, because Codex turns `-` into `_`.
- Values go through the CLI's own checks, as the text of the value (`12.5` is `12.5`), and the messages keep CLI syntax: `tap {"x": 1, "y": 2, "duration": 1.5}` fails with `--duration must be a whole number of milliseconds (got '1.5')`.
- `null` counts as not given. An argument the tool does not take is refused: `'devices' does not take the option '--foo'`.
- `inline` exists only here: `true` or `false`, else `INVALID_ARGS` `inline must be true or false (got 'yes')`.
- `out` and `apk` should be absolute. A relative path resolves against the server's working directory, which the client picks.
- `device` picks one of several devices. Without it the server uses `KARAGOZ_DEVICE`, then `ANDROID_SERIAL` from its own environment, then the only device ([Device selection](#device-selection)). Codex passes these variables only through `env_vars`.

### Results

- Success: one text block with the command's JSON line.
- Failure: `isError: true` and one text block with the CLI's error envelope. `karagoz: <message>` goes to stderr, as in the CLI.
- An unknown tool name is a JSON-RPC error, `-32602` `Unknown tool: <name>`.
- `screenshot` with `inline: true` adds the full-resolution PNG as an `image` block. Clients scale it before the model sees it (Claude Code sent a 1080x2400 capture as a JPEG), so take coordinates from `ui_tree` bounds, or from `pixels` and `scale`, never from the image.

```

### Behavior

- Calls run in parallel, except UiAutomation reads (`ui_tree`, and `tap` with `text` or `id`), which take turns per device inside one server. Another process that holds UiAutomation still causes `AUTOMATION_BUSY`.
- A cancelled call kills its adb child at once and gets no response. The device does not stop with it: it keeps its UiAutomation slot for about 1-2 s, so a `ui_tree` right after can get `AUTOMATION_BUSY`; a gesture already sent finishes on the device; and a cancelled `install` may leave the app installed. Esc in Claude Code cancels the running call: the adb dump was gone within 0.3 s and the server kept running.
- stdin closing, SIGINT and SIGTERM cancel every call the same way; the process exits with `0`, `130` and `143`.
- The server keeps the `adb` it found for the whole session. If that file disappears (`ENOENT`), the next call looks it up again.

### Token cost

What the server adds to a Claude Code session, measured on 2026-10-04 with Claude Code 2.1.289 and `claude-opus-5-5`: input tokens of the first API call with karagoz registered, minus the same call with no MCP server.

| Case | Tokens |
| --- | --- |
| Every session, tool search on (the default): the 13 tool names and `instructions` | 325 |
| All 13 definitions, loaded by one `ToolSearch` call | 2,215 |
| Every session, tool search off (`ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=false`): every definition and `instructions` | 2,091 |

The `tools/list` result is 5,643 characters and `instructions` 373. One `ui_tree` of the launcher home screen is 5,383 characters.

## Scope

karagoz is the primitive layer. Each command does one thing and exits.

- **Not a test framework.** No assertions, no test runner, no recorded flows, no retry policy, no reports. `tap --timeout` waits for a node to appear; it never repeats an action.
- **Not a design comparison tool.** Figma diffing, measurement and reporting belong a layer above. karagoz produces the raw input, and the metadata to measure it with, but does not interpret it.

## Development

```sh
npm run build       # empty dist/, then bundle to dist/cli.js and two chunks
npm run typecheck
npm run lint        # oxlint and the Prettier check; npm run format fixes formatting
```

Each step has one smoke script in `smoke/`. Each builds first and needs a running emulator, `smoke/M-mcp.sh` included, except `smoke/0b-version.sh`, `smoke/1.7-doctor.sh`, `smoke/2.2-screenshot-physical.sh`, `smoke/2.3-ui-tree-physical.sh`, `smoke/2.4-input-physical.sh`, `smoke/2.5-app-lifecycle-physical.sh`, `smoke/2.6-logs-physical.sh`, `smoke/3.1-devices-ios.sh` and `smoke/3.2-screenshot-ios.sh`: 1.7 uses fake `adb` scripts only and never runs the real adb, 3.1 uses fake `adb` and `simctl` scripts and reads the real simulator list, 3.2 uses fake `adb` and `simctl` scripts and captures a booted simulator when one runs (else its real step prints `SKIP`), both macOS only (they print `SKIP` elsewhere), and 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 need a phone only for their phone step, which they skip when none is listed. The header of each script lists its preconditions:

```sh
sh smoke/1.4-input.sh
```

`smoke/1.5-app-lifecycle.sh` also builds a test APK on every run, and `smoke/2.5-app-lifecycle-physical.sh` when a phone is attached, with `smoke/fixtures/app-lifecycle/build.sh` from the manifest in that folder, and installs and removes it as `dev.karagoz.smoke`. No APK is kept in the repository. They need a JDK (`java` and `keytool` on `PATH`) and, from the Android SDK, build-tools with `aapt2` and `apksigner` plus one platform. The SDK is the first of `$ANDROID_HOME`, `$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`, `~/Library/Android/sdk` and `~/Android/Sdk` that has both `build-tools/` and `platforms/`. When something is missing the smoke fails and says what, rather than skipping.

The full check, with the emulator running:

```sh
npm run typecheck && npm run lint && for s in smoke/*.sh; do sh "$s" || exit 1; done
```
